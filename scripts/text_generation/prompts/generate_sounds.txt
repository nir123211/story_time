Given the JSON file of storylines formatted as `"line{line number}"` as the key and the actual line as the value, write a new JSON file. This new file should use `"line{line number}"` as the key, with the value being a dictionary containing the following fields:

1. `music`: An up to five-word description of the music that sets the tone for the current story theme. This field is optional and should be used only when the story atmosphere shifts. However, `line1` will always have music, use this field at the start, middle and before the end of the story.
2. `sound`: An up to five-word description of a sound effect (only one) that matches the current line. This field is optional.

The JSON file should be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "line1": {
    "music": "Description of music for line1",
    "sound": "Description of sound effect for line1"
  },
  "line2": {
    "sound": "Description of sound effect for line2"
  },
  ...
}
```

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

Given storylines:
```json
{
  "line1": "John and Jane stood on the hill, watching the sunset.",
  "line2": "Jane laughed as John told a joke.",
  "line3": "A sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves."
}
```

The resulting JSON file should look like:
```json
{
  "line1": {
    "music": "Gentle acoustic guitar",
    "sound": "Soft breeze"
  },
  "line2": {
    "sound": "Laughter"
  },
  "line3": {
    "sound": "Rustling leaves"
  }
}
```

Please ensure each description is concise and accurately reflects the atmosphere and action of the line. Use the `music` field sparingly, only when there is a notable shift in the story's phase or theme.
