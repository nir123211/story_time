Given a JSON file of storylines formatted as `"line{line number}"` as the key and the actual line as the value, write a new JSON file. The new file should use `"line{line number}"` as the key, with the value being a dictionary containing the following fields:

1. **`music`**:  
   - Select music that establishes the tone for the next storylines.  
   - Choose from the following options:  
     `[action_music.mp3, ambient_music.mp3, ambient_tension_music.mp3, dramatic_music.mp3, epic_music.mp3, fantasy_music.mp3, funny_music.mp3, happy_music.mp3, romantic_music.mp3, sad_music.mp3, sci_fi_music.mp3, silence.mp3, space_music.mp3, suspense_music.mp3, tension_music.mp3, victory_music.mp3]`.  
   - This field is required for `line1` and optional for subsequent lines.  
   - Use this field only when there is a significant atmospheric shift. It should appear **1-4 times total**, no more than once per line.

2. **`sound`**:  
   - Provide a vivid, detailed description of a sound effect that matches the current line.  
   - The description should focus on environmental or non-human sounds and avoid references to human speech or music (human sounds like laughs are ok).
   - This field is optional and should be used for **up to one-third** of the total lines.

**Output Format**:  

```json
{
  "line1": {
    "music": "Selected music option for line1",
    "sound": "Detailed description of a sound effect for line1"
  },
  "line2": {
    "sound": "Detailed description of a sound effect for line2"
  },
  ...
}
```

**Example**:  

Given input storylines:  
```json
{
  "line1": "John and Jane stood on the hill, watching the sunset.",
  "line2": "Jane laughed as John told a joke.",
  "line3": "A sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves.",
  "line4": "Thunder rolled in the distance as dark clouds gathered."
}
```

The output should look like:  
```json
{
  "line1": {
    "music": "ambient_music.mp3",
    "sound": "The gentle whisper of a cool breeze sweeping across the hilltop"
  },
  "line2": {
    "sound": "Bright laughter carried by the light wind"
  },
  "line3": {
    "sound": "The crisp rustling of leaves stirred by a sudden gust"
  },
  "line4": {
    "music": "tension_music.mp3",
    "sound": "A deep rumble of distant thunder rolling through the darkening sky"
  }
}
```

### Notes:  
- Ensure all descriptions are vivid, immersive, and concise.  
- Music should complement shifts in atmosphere or tone without excessive use.  
- Limit sound effects to align with the one-third usage cap and focus on environmental or action-based sounds.
