Task:
Given a JSON file of storylines formatted as "line{line number}" as the key and the actual line as the value, write a new JSON file. Each key should map to a dictionary containing the following fields:

1. music

* Select music that establishes or enhances the tone for the next storylines.
* Choose from the following options:
  \[action\_music.mp3, ambient\_music.mp3, ambient\_tension\_music.mp3, dramatic\_music.mp3, epic\_music.mp3, fantasy\_music.mp3, funny\_music.mp3, happy\_music.mp3, romantic\_music.mp3, sad\_music.mp3, sci\_fi\_music.mp3, silence.mp3, space\_music.mp3, suspense\_music.mp3, tension\_music.mp3, victory\_music.mp3]
* This field is required for line1 to establish the story’s initial atmosphere.
* For subsequent lines, use music only if there is a significant shift in tone or atmosphere.
* Limit to 1–4 total uses, and never more than once per line.
* Avoid repeating the same music for consecutive lines unless the atmosphere truly hasn’t shifted.

2. sound

* Provide a vivid, detailed description of a non-human or environmental sound that matches the current line.
* Focus on natural or mechanical sounds (wind, water, birds, machinery, footsteps, rain, thunder, etc.). Human sounds are optional (laughs, cries, footsteps) but avoid dialogue.
* Use sound for up to one-third of the total lines.
* Make descriptions immersive, concise, and complementary to the music and visuals.
* Include multi-sensory environmental richness: describe texture, intensity, and layered background elements. Example: "The crisp rustling of leaves stirred by a sudden gust, mingling with distant dripping water and faint bird calls."

Additional Guidelines:

* Keep music and sound tied to characters, locations, and world identity from the story.
* Ensure audio reflects the story’s style, mood, and atmosphere.
* Avoid overloading the scene with too many sounds; focus on the most relevant environmental cues.

Output Format:

* Return a JSON mapping each storyline line to its music and/or sound fields. Only include fields where applicable.

Example Input Storylines:
{
"line1": "Alex and Maya stood on the hill, watching the sunset.",
"line2": "Maya laughed as Alex told a joke.",

}

Example Output JSON:
{
"line1": {
"music": "ambient\_music.mp3",
"sound": "The gentle whisper of a cool breeze sweeping across the hilltop, carrying the faint scent of wildflowers and rustling grass."
},
"line2": {
"sound": "Bright laughter carried by the light wind, mingling with distant bird calls from the forest below."
},
"line3": {
"sound": "The crisp rustling of leaves stirred by a sudden gust, accompanied by the soft clatter of loose branches."
},
"line4": {
"music": "tension\_music.mp3",
