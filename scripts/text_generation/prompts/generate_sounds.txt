Given the JSON file of storylines formatted as `"line{line number}"` as the key and the actual line as the value, write a new JSON file. This new file should use `"line{line number}"` as the key, with the value being a dictionary containing the following fields:

1. `music`: Select music that sets the tone for the next storylines.
   Select the music from the options:
   [action_music.mp3, ambient_music.mp3, ambient_tension_music.mp3, dramatic_music.mp3, epic_music.mp3, fantasy_music.mp3,
   funny_music.mp3, happy_music.mp3, romantic_music.mp3, sad_music.mp3, sci_fi_music.mp3, silence.mp3,
   space_music.mp3, suspense_music.mp3, tension_music.mp3, victory_music.mp3].
   This field is optional and should be used only when the story atmosphere shifts. However, `line1` will always have music. Use this field between 2-5 times throughout the storyline.

2. `sound`: A detailed description of a sound effect that matches the current line. Make the sound effect descriptions vivid and descriptive, vividly capturing the atmosphere and action. This field is optional.

The JSON file should be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "line1": {
    "music": "Description of music for line1",
    "sound": "Description of sound effect for line1"
  },
  "line2": {
    "sound": "Description of sound effect for line2"
  },
  ...
}
```

---

### Example

Given storylines:
```json
{
  "line1": "John and Jane stood on the hill, watching the sunset.",
  "line2": "Jane laughed as John told a joke.",
  "line3": "A sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves."
}
```

The resulting JSON file should look like:
```json
{
  "line1": {
    "music": "ambient_music.mp3",
    "sound": "The soft whisper of a gentle breeze accompanied by the faint rustle of distant grass"
  },
  "line2": {
    "sound": "Bright, melodic laughter ringing out in the open air"
  },
  "line3": {
    "sound": "Crisp rustling of leaves stirred by a sudden, playful gust of wind"
  }
}
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure each description is concise but vivid, providing enough detail to immerse the reader in the atmosphere of the scene.
- Use the `music` field sparingly, only when there is a notable shift in the story's phase or theme.
- Make sound descriptions evoke a sense of presence, clearly tying them to the context of the storyline.
