Given a story prompt and a story, create a JSON file that contains each main character's name as the key. For each key, provide a short but accurate description of the character's physical appearance (excluding their clothing). The descriptions should include essential aspects such as facial features, hair color and style, eye color, body type, and any distinguishing marks or features. Ensure the descriptions are consistent enough to recreate approximately the same character every time. The JSON file should be structured as follows:

{
  "CharacterName1": {
    "description": "Short description of CharacterName1's physical appearance."
  },
  "CharacterName2": {
    "description": "Short description of CharacterName2's physical appearance."
  },
  ...
}

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

{
  "John Doe": {
    "description": "John Doe has sharp features, piercing blue eyes, short black hair, and a muscular build with a slight scar above his left eyebrow."
  },
  "Jane Smith": {
    "description": "Jane Smith has a heart-shaped face, green eyes, wavy auburn hair, and a slender build with fair skin."
  }
}

Please ensure each description is unique and captures the essence of the character's appearance concisely.
