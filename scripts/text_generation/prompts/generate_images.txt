Using a JSON file of character descriptions and another JSON file of storylines, generate a new JSON file where each storyline line is transformed into an independent and detailed image prompt.

### Requirements:

1. **Independent Prompts**: Each image prompt must fully describe the scene without relying on other lines or external context.
2. **Visual Focus**: Capture the essence of the line with precise and vivid descriptions of all observable elements, including the setting, action, and characters.
3. **Style**:
   - **Always start each prompt by specifying the style** (e.g., “A photorealistic depiction”).
   - Use the **same style consistently** for all prompts.
4. **Character Descriptions**:
   - Use the provided character description JSON to reference characters exactly as listed in the format `_character_`.
   - Ensure consistency in their features and implied age (e.g., youthful, mature, elderly).
   - Describe characters **only by their physical attributes and attire**, avoiding names or personal details.
5. **Non-Human Characters**: Clearly describe their physical traits and specify their type.
6. **Environmental Details**: Fully reflect the setting and action described in the storyline to enhance the visual scene.

### Example Input:

**Character Descriptions**:
```json
{
  "Character1": {
    "description": "A man with a square jawline, piercing blue eyes, short sandy blonde hair, and a lean athletic build, exuding a mature and confident presence."
  },
  "Character2": {
    "description": "A woman with a heart-shaped face, green eyes, long wavy auburn hair, and a slender, graceful figure, giving her a youthful appearance."
  }
}
```

**Storylines**:
```json
{
  "line1": "_Character1_ strolled along the forest's edge.",
  "line2": "_Character2_ knelt by a clear stream."
}
```

### Example Output:

```json
{
  "line1": {
    "prompt": "A photorealistic depiction of _Character1_ walking along the edge of a tranquil forest. The forest is dense with tall trees, vibrant foliage, and patches of soft grass under golden evening light."
  },
  "line2": {
    "prompt": "A photorealistic depiction of _Character2_ kneeling by a clear, sparkling stream. The stream is surrounded by mossy stones and vibrant wildflowers under a canopy of lush greenery."
  }
}
```
