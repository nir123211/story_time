Task:
Using a JSON file of storylines and a JSON file describing the story’s world, characters, and locations, generate a new JSON file where each storyline line is transformed into a standalone image prompt.

Each prompt should reflect the visual tone, setting, and consistency of the world while staying short and vivid.
End each prompt with a short parenthetical tag indicating the main visual focus — e.g. (focus: character), (focus: action), (focus: object), or (focus: atmosphere).

Requirements:

1. Primary Focus

   * Identify the dominant visual element for each scene: a character, action, object, or atmosphere.
   * Mention characters and locations only if relevant to the scene.
   * Align tone, lighting, and palette with the world JSON (art style, mood, and environment).

2. Environment & Composition

   * Always specify the location in the scene.
   * Optionally include framing cues (e.g., close-up, wide shot, aerial view).
   * Keep text concise and visually clear.

3. Independence

   * Each prompt must stand alone and make full sense without story context.
   * Avoid elaborating character or location details — use only minimal identifiers.

Output Format:
Return a JSON mapping each storyline line to an object with "prompt":

{
"line_1": {
"prompt": "Wide shot of Arin walking through the neon-lit streets of Lumeport, reflections glimmering in the puddles — cinematic tone, cool palette. (focus: character)"
},
"line_2": {
"prompt": "Close-up of an ancient compass resting on a wooden desk under flickering candlelight. (focus: object)"
},
"line_3": {
"prompt": "Stormy coastline at dusk, waves crashing against the rocks beneath a violet sky. (focus: atmosphere)"
}
}
