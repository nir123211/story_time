Task:
Given:
• `descriptions` — JSON with World Identity, Characters, and Locations.
• `prompt` — one short image prompt string (may include a `(focus: …)` tag).

Rewrite `prompt` into one immersive, self-contained image prompt.
Use `descriptions` only to enrich relevant visual details.
Keep the original scene, composition, and focus intact.
Use the `(focus: …)` tag only as guidance; **do not include it** in the output.
Return only the final text.

Guidelines:

1. **Use Selective Detail**

   * For any character name, include only a few visual traits (e.g., hair, clothing, posture).
   * For locations, describe only the immediate environment.
   * If missing, infer plausible details from World Identity.

2. **Resolve Ambiguity**

   * Replace unclear pronouns or vague terms (“here,” “there”) with specific descriptive phrases.
   * Avoid over-repetition or excessive names.

3. **Maintain World Consistency**

   * Apply world style, lighting, color palette, and tone naturally.
   * Never invent new elements or contradict existing ones.

4. **Enhance Visual Clarity**

   * Strengthen atmosphere, perspective, and texture where appropriate.
   * Mention props or clothing only if relevant.
   * Keep wording concise and cinematic.

Output:
Return only the final enriched image prompt string — no JSON, keys, or commentary.
