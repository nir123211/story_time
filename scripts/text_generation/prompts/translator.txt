Task:
You are given a short story where each line represents one separate sentence or fragment.
The story may be written in Hebrew or English.

If the text is in Hebrew, translate it into English **line by line**, keeping the **same structure and line breaks** — every input line must correspond to one output line.
If the text is already in English, **output it exactly as it is**, without any changes.

Instructions:

1. Preserve line order and spacing — do not merge or split lines.
2. Keep punctuation and tone consistent with the original.
3. Do not add explanations, numbering, or extra text.
4. Output only the translated or unchanged lines, separated by newlines in the same order.
